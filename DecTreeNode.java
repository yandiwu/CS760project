/*
 * This class represents a node in a decision tree. 
 * 
 * It has fields for:
 * - feature - the feature on which split at this node happens
 * - threshold - the value of the threshold for the feature chosen
 * - left - pointer to the left child node
 * - right - pointer to the right child node 
 * - classLabel - the value 0 or 1 which represents label assigned 
 * 			to instances at this node if this is a leaf node
